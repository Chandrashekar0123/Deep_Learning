Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on the interaction between computers and human languages. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is meaningful. NLP techniques are used in applications such as text generation, sentiment analysis, translation, chatbots, and more.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Recurrent Neural Networks are specialized for processing sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps. They are well-suited for tasks like text generation, language modeling, and sentiment analysis. However, traditional RNNs face challenges like the vanishing gradient problem, making them less effective for long sequences.

Key Features:

Sequential processing with feedback connections.

Captures short-term dependencies in data.

Limitations include difficulty handling long-term dependencies.

Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

LSTMs are an advanced type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem. They use special structures called gates to selectively retain or discard information over long sequences, making them ideal for tasks requiring long-term context understanding.

Key Features:

Memory cells with input, forget, and output gates.

Retains information over long sequences.

Excellent for complex NLP tasks like machine translation.

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)

GRUs are a simplified variant of LSTMs that combine the forget and input gates into a single update gate. They are computationally less expensive while offering comparable performance, making them a popular choice for sequence modeling.

Key Features:

Fewer parameters compared to LSTMs.

Combines memory and update mechanisms efficiently.

Suitable for applications with limited computational resources.

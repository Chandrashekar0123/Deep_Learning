Face Recognition 

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning architectures, AlexNet and a custom CNN, for face recognition. The model is trained to classify and identify faces based on the given dataset. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in face recognition tasks, which can be used in applications like authentication systems, attendance systems, and more.

Dataset Details


The dataset contains:

Images: High-quality images of multiple individuals.

Labels: Corresponding class labels for each individual.

Dataset Preparation : 
Download the dataset from Kaggle using the link above.
Extract the dataset into folders categorized by individual names.
Perform data preprocessing and augmentation (e.g., scaling, normalization, flipping, and rotation).


Implementation Steps

1. Data Preprocessing : 
Rescale image pixel values to a range of [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 for AlexNet compatibility).
Augment the data using techniques like rotation, horizontal flipping, zooming, and shifting to increase diversity.


2. Model Architectures :
   
AlexNet : 
Use a pre-trained AlexNet model for transfer learning.
Fine-tune the fully connected layers for the face recognition task.
Leverage the feature extraction power of AlexNet's convolutional layers.

Custom CNN : 
Design a custom CNN with layers such as:
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the images.
Batch Normalization: Normalize the activations to improve stability.
Pooling Layers: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
Fully Connected Layers: Classify the extracted features into the target classes.


3. Model Compilation : 
Use Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy for multi-class classification.
Metrics: Accuracy for performance evaluation.


4. Training and Validation : 
Split the dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% validation).
Train the model for a fixed number of epochs with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Monitor training and validation accuracy and loss.


5. Evaluation : 
Evaluate the model on a separate test set.
Generate a confusion matrix and calculate metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.


6. Deployment (Optional) : 
Convert the model into a format compatible with deployment platforms (e.g., TensorFlow Lite for mobile, ONNX for cross-platform use).
